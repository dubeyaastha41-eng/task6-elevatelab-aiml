# Task 6 – K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

This repository contains the implementation of the KNN classification algorithm as part of the AI & ML Internship Task 6.

## 📌 Objective
- Implement KNN on the Iris dataset.
- Normalize the features.
- Experiment with different values of K.
- Evaluate the model using accuracy & confusion matrix.
- Visualize decision boundaries.

## 📁 Files Included
- knn_classification.ipynb – Jupyter notebook version.
- knn_classification.py – Python script version.
- plots/ – Images of graphs and decision boundaries.
- README.md – Project documentation.

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the *Iris dataset*.
2. Normalized features using *StandardScaler*.
3. Split data into *train/test* sets.
4. Trained *KNeighborsClassifier* from sklearn.
5. Evaluated accuracy, confusion matrix & classification report.
6. Plotted:
   - Accuracy vs K
   - Decision boundary (2D)

## 🧪 Accuracy
The model achieved *~96–100% accuracy* depending on K.

## 📚 Libraries Used
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## 📤 Submission
After uploading all files, submit your GitHub repository link using the internship form.
